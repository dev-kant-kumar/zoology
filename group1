 2.2 Ornithine Cycle (Urea Cycle)

The ornithine cycle, also known as the urea cycle or Krebs-Henseleit cycle, is the primary mechanism for converting toxic ammonia to less harmful urea in mammals.

 Location and Significance
- Location: Primarily in liver hepatocytes (some steps in mitochondria, others in cytoplasm)
- Function: Converts ammonia (NH₃) to urea (CO(NH₂)₂)
- Evolutionary advantage: Allows terrestrial animals to excrete nitrogenous waste with minimal water loss

 Steps of the Ornithine Cycle

Step 1: Formation of Carbamoyl Phosphate
- Enzyme: Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I)
- Location: Mitochondrial matrix
- Reaction: NH₃ + CO₂ + 2ATP → Carbamoyl phosphate + 2ADP + Pi
- Regulation: Activated by N-acetylglutamate

Step 2: Formation of Citrulline
- Enzyme: Ornithine transcarbamoylase
- Location: Mitochondrial matrix
- Reaction: Carbamoyl phosphate + Ornithine → Citrulline + Pi

Step 3: Formation of Argininosuccinate
- Enzyme: Argininosuccinate synthetase
- Location: Cytoplasm
- Reaction: Citrulline + Aspartate + ATP → Argininosuccinate + AMP + PPi

Step 4: Formation of Arginine
- Enzyme: Argininosuccinate lyase
- Location: Cytoplasm
- Reaction: Argininosuccinate → Arginine + Fumarate

Step 5: Formation of Urea
- Enzyme: Arginase
- Location: Cytoplasm
- Reaction: Arginine + H₂O → Urea + Ornithine

 Regulation of Urea Cycle
- Allosteric regulation: N-acetylglutamate activates CPS I
- Substrate availability: Ammonia concentration directly affects cycle rate
- Hormonal regulation: Glucagon and cortisol increase enzyme synthesis
- Nutritional state: High protein diet increases enzyme levels

 Clinical Significance
