 2.2 Ornithine Cycle (Urea Cycle)

The ornithine cycle, also known as the urea cycle or Krebs-Henseleit cycle, is the primary mechanism for converting toxic ammonia to less harmful urea in mammals.

# Location and Significance

Step 2: Formation of Citrulline
- Enzyme: Ornithine transcarbamoylase
- Location: Mitochondrial matrix
- Reaction: Carbamoyl phosphate + Ornithine → Citrulline + Pi

Step 3: Formation of Argininosuccinate
- Enzyme: Argininosuccinate synthetase
